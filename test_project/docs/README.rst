Starting with the docs
======================

We are using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to manage our documentation.
If you have never worked with ``Sphinx`` this guide
will cover the most common uses cases.


Quickstart
----------

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies, `here's how to do it <_pages/template/dependencies.rst>`_
3. ``cd docs && make html``
4. Open ``_build/html/index.html`` with your browser


Where to go next
----------------

After you have your docs compiled, then it is time to read it.
We recommend you to start from exploring ``Project`` docs first.
That's the place we write what our projects are about.
Why they were created and what problems we are solving with it.

If you will find any question about how to setup your working environment,
refer to the ``template`` section.
